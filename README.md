## Section 1) General Programming:

Within the eclipse project is the **AnagramTest** which runs the tests to check for anagrams. The test will pass or fail depending if one word is an anagram of the other.

## Question 2: Whats wrong with the given code below:

This code is will create an infinate loop as **Hostelworld** is spelt wrong in the _main_ method

## Section 2) Front End automationn

Within the eclipse project is the **HostelworldSearchTests** which runs the required tests. Ive create a couple of page objects for this purpose to deomonstrate how i feel testing should happen in frameworks. Obviously this is a simpler version of what would we done in larger system.

##Section 2) API Testing

Still some autentication items to do, but succesfully create public gist and getting id from same. I would in general create json objects for the info from GIt to allow much easier usage for testing, but didnt have time to complete.
